The Line Following Robot operates as an automated feedback system that translates environmental data into mechanical movement. It uses a logic-based approach to ensure the robot remains aligned with its intended path.

### 1. Path Detection (Input Layer)
The robot uses two sensors (Left and Right) to monitor the surface below:

Sensor Type: The simulation uses PIR/IR sensors connected to Digital Pins 2 and 3.

Signal Processing: These sensors detect the contrast between the line (usually dark) and the floor (usually light). When a sensor "sees" the path, it sends a HIGH signal to the Arduino; otherwise, it stays LOW.

### 2. The Power Safety SwitchA manual switch (S1/S2) has been integrated into the circuit after the battery and motor driver stages:Purpose: This acts as a physical "Kill Switch" or toggle to interrupt power flow to the motors.Operation: Even if the Arduino sends a "Forward" command, the motors will not spin unless this switch is closed, allowing for safe testing and calibration of the sensors without the robot driving off the table.### 3. Logic & Microcontroller ProcessingThe Arduino UNO acts as the central processor, running a continuous loop to evaluate sensor states:Move Forward: Both sensors detect the line (Left: HIGH, Right: HIGH).Correct Left: Only the right sensor is on the line (Left: LOW, Right: HIGH). The Arduino stops the left motor, causing the robot to pivot left back onto the path.Correct Right: Only the left sensor is on the line (Left: HIGH, Right: LOW). The Arduino stops the right motor to pivot right.Full Stop: Neither sensor detects a line (Left: LOW, Right: LOW), and all motor pins are set to LOW.### 4. Motor Drive (Actuation Layer)Since the Arduino cannot provide the high current required by DC motors, the L293D Motor Driver is utilized:Bridge Control: It takes low-power signals from Arduino pins 8, 9, 10, and 11 to switch the high-power 9V battery supply to the motors.Status Indicators: The circuit includes LEDs (Green/Yellow) with current-limiting resistors ($1k\Omega$) to provide visual feedback of the system's power and motor status.
